{1 Js_of_ocaml Bingings for WebRTC Web API}

This library provides bindings to the WebRTC Web API... they're not complete nor 
are they well documented. But they're enough to build some cool little web apps.

 - {! Rtc.PeerConnection} contains the code for working with RTC peer connections.
 - {! Rtc.DataChannel} for representing a network channel which can be used
    for bidirectional peer-to-peer transfer of data.

{2 Examples}

 - The {{:/jsoo-rtc/simple-data-channel} simple data channel} example allows two compontents on the 
 page to communicate using an {! Rtc.DataChannel}.
 - The {{:/jsoo-rtc/simple-video-call} simple video call} example sets up a call between you and... yourself!
 Beware of audio feedback!
